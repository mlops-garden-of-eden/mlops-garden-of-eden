# --- Development Environment Overrides ---
#
# This file overrides settings in 'base_config.yaml' for fast, local, and isolated development runs.
#
# Primary Goals:
# 1. Use sampled/local data for speed.
# 2. Run multiple model types for comparative testing.
# 3. Use a scratchpad MLflow experiment.

data:
  # In development, point to a small sample dataset for rapid testing
  features_table_name: "processed_features_SAMPLE_dev"
  
# --- Tuning/Execution Configuration ---
tuning:
  # In Dev, we want to run all the candidate models to compare performance.
  models_to_run:
    - "RandomForestClassifier"
    - "XGBoostClassifier"
    - "LogisticRegression"

# --- MLOps/Tracking Configuration ---
tracking:
  # Use a separate, temporary experiment for all development runs to keep the production experiment clean.
