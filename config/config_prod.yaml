# --- Production Environment Overrides ---
#
# This file overrides settings in 'base_config.yaml' for the final, continuous, and validated production pipeline.
#
# Primary Goals:
# 1. Use the full, curated production feature table.
# 2. Run only the single, approved production model.
# 3. Lock down final hyperparameters.

# --- Tuning/Execution Configuration ---
tuning:
  # In Prod, we only execute the pipeline for the one model selected for deployment.
  models_to_run:
    - "LogisticRegression"

# --- Model Hyperparameter Locking ---
# We override the model definition here to ensure only the final, optimal hyperparameters are used.
models:
  LogisticRegression:
    hyperparameters:
      # We override the potential list from base_config to a single, locked-down value:

  # Replace {run_id} with your actual MLflow run ID from Databricks
